## 🎯 Introduction
The Context-Aware AI-Driven Testing System is an advanced, multi-agent AI-powered framework
designed to automate financial test generation, execution, fraud detection, and compliance
validation. This system leverages Generative AI with LLM’s, NLP, and ML models to create dynamic
test cases from various financial data sources, ensuring optimal accuracy, security, and efficiency in
financial transactions.

## 💡 Inspiration
Traditional test case generation is time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error. Testers struggle to
create real-world financial transaction test scenarios covering fraud detection, regulatory compliance, and
risk assessment. Financial institutions maintain millions of test cases, many of which become obsolete or
redundant over time. Manual updates to test cases are not scalable and result in poor test coverage when
system changes occur.
## ⚙️ What It Does
Connects to various sources, gnerates the test cases, updates the test cases, generates the automation scripts and executes the tests 
## 🛠️ How We Built It
